# Functional Sandbox 😎😎😎😎😎

Hi, If you stumble on this, it's simply a test for me to get acquainted with *Github* and *Functional Programming*.

The codes here have been made while studying with this book: [Functional Programming in JavaScript] (https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-javascript) of Luis Atencio.
